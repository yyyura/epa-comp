Week 10 Lab
Using Linux redirect

(a) Linux redirect using > 

Redirect takes the contents which would otherwise appear on the screen and saves the contents to a file. 

EG

[epa@localhost ~]$  echo "this goes to a file truncating it first" > file.txt

here, file.txt will be truncated to zero bytes before the write. If the file exists prior to redirecting it will be truncated without warning

(b) Linux redirect using >>

Because > truncates a file to zero bytes, we would like a redirect that appends to the file if it exists, and creates it if it does not exist. This is the purpose of >>


[epa@localhost ~]$  echo "this goes to a file appending it" >> file.txt

 We can also embed commands into an echo & redirect

[epa@localhost ~]$  echo "`date` this goes to a file appending it" >> file.txt

(c) Counting files in /tmp

Write a script to count the number of files in /tmp. If the number of files exceeds a parameter, have the script write an error message to a log file, using redirect append 

(d) using the commands together in a cron script

If we want to run a job periodically, using crontab

[epa@localhost ~]$  crontab -e

We can specify

minute (from 0 to 59)
hour (from 0 to 23)
day of month (from 1 to 31)
month (from 1 to 12)
day of week (from 0 to 6) (0=Sunday)
and the last parameter is the job to run


(e) Put your script into cron to run every minute

(f) Check your work into github
